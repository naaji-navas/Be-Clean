# BeClean - Environmental Awareness and Community Cleaning App

## Problem Statement

BeClean is a solution to address the challenge of increasing environmental awareness and encouraging community members to take action in cleaning their local areas. The core problem statement I aim to solve is:

"How can I use technology to increase environmental awareness and encourage people to take action in their communities? Specifically, how can I design an app that allows users to identify areas in need of cleaning, organize and participate in cleaning events, and receive rewards for their efforts?"

This problem statement highlights the main issue the app intends to tackle and outlines its key features, which include:

- Identifying areas in need of cleaning.
- Organizing and participating in cleaning events.
- Rewarding users for their participation in community cleanups.

My motivation for developing BeClean is to create a positive impact on the environment and communities. I believe that by providing an easy-to-use platform that empowers individuals to make a difference, I can contribute to a cleaner and healthier world. By utilizing technology and gamification, I aim to make the process of environmental stewardship more engaging and rewarding, thereby inspiring more people to take action.
